## Feature: Search Functionality

The application includes a `filterAndSearch()` function, which enhances the user interface by allowing dynamic searching and filtering of user data. This function accepts an array of user objects as its argument. It then applies filtering criteria to select users that match specific conditions. A user is included in the filtered result if their gender aligns with the applied filter or if their information contains the search term within any of the specified search parameters.
